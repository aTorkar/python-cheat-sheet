    "1. __Repository:__\n",
    "A repository is a collection of files and version history managed by Git.\n",
    "1. __Git:__\n",
    "Git is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in files.\n",
    "1. __Commit:__\n",
    "A commit is a snapshot of the repository at a specific point in time, representing a set of changes.\n",
    "1. __Branch:__\n",
    "A branch is an independent line of development in a repository, allowing multiple streams of work.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Merge:__\n",
    "Merging combines changes from one branch into another, integrating divergent lines of development.\n",
    "1. __Remote:__\n",
    "A remote is a repository hosted on a different server or location, allowing collaboration and synchronization.\n",
    "1. __Clone:__\n",
    "Cloning creates a local copy of a remote repository, enabling you to work on it independently.\n",
    "1. __Pull:__\n",
    "Pulling fetches changes from a remote repository and integrates them into the current branch.\n",
    "1. __Push:__\n",
    "Pushing sends local commits to a remote repository, updating its branch with your changes.\n",
    "1. __Fetch:__\n",
    "Fetching retrieves changes from a remote repository without merging them into the current branch.\n",
    "1. __Origin:__\n",
    "Origin is a common default name for the remote repository from which a local repository was cloned.\n",
    "1. __Fork:__\n",
    "Forking creates a personal copy of a repository, allowing you to contribute to it separately.\n",
    "1. __Staging Area:__\n",
    "The staging area is a space where changes are prepared for a commit by selecting which files to include.\n",
    "1. __Conflict:__\n",
    "A conflict occurs when Git cannot automatically merge changes and requires manual resolution.\n",
    "1. __Pull Request:__\n",
    "A pull request is a request to merge changes from one branch or fork to another, often used in collaboration workflows.\n",
    "1. __Tag:__\n",
    "A tag is a named pointer to a specific commit, commonly used to mark important milestones or releases.\n",
    "1. __Checkout:__\n",
    "Checkout switches between branches or commits, updating the working directory to reflect the selected state.\n",
    "1. __Rebase:__\n",
    "Rebasing applies changes from one branch onto another, moving or modifying the commit history.\n",
    "1. __Gitignore:__\n",
    "The .gitignore file specifies patterns of files or directories that should be ignored by Git.\n",
    "1. __Cherry-pick:__\n",
    "Cherry-picking selects and applies specific commits from one branch to another, allowing you to pick individual changes.\n",
    "1. __Revert:__\n",
    "Reverting undoes a previous commit by creating a new commit that undoes the changes introduced in the original commit.\n",
    "1. __HEAD:__\n",
    "HEAD represents the currently checked out commit or branch, serving as a reference point for the current state of the repository.\n",
    "1. __Git Pull --rebase:__\n",
    "Pulling with the --rebase flag combines fetching changes from a remote repository with rebasing the current branch, avoiding unnecessary merge commits.\n",
    "1. __Git Clean:__\n",
    "Git clean removes untracked files from the working directory, helping to keep the repository clean and free of unnecessary files.\n",
    "1. __Submodule:__\n",
    "A submodule is a nested Git repository within another repository, allowing you to include external projects as dependencies."

    "is used to temporarily save changes that are not ready to be committed in a Git repository. It allows you to store modifications made to tracked files, including changes in the working directory and the staging area (index), without committing them. Stashing provides a way to switch branches, work on a different task, or merge changes, without losing your current work. The git stash command creates a new stash, which captures the current state of your working directory, and allows you to revert back to that state at a later time.\n",
